## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

This app has basic some functional unit tests and some integration tests

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

- table design can be improved
  - username can be a color
  - the table can have a height according to the window size
  - activate internal scrolling for the data table so that the search bar is always visible
  - preloader can be placed inside Data table with an overlay
- Can be responsive
- I prefer using CSS instead of sx attribute. although Mui offering this API but reviewers can find this not good as it is basically inline css.

- add test for sortByUsername function
